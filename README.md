# SearchOnGraph
BFS parallel implementation.


Breath-First Search (from now on I will refer to it as BFS) is a well-known
algorithm used to process graphs. The computation maintains two frontiers: the
first one is used to process the current level of nodes, where the latter is used to
keep track of the childrenâ€™s nodes of the previous frontier. The algorithm repeats
until the next frontier is empty. Since each nodes is independent from the others
we focus on a particular kind of Data-Parallel Problem: the embarrassingly-
parallel one.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* download and install Fastflow 
  ```sh
  https://github.com/fastflow/fastflow
  ```
* compiling generation graph
  ```sh
      g++ -std=c++17 gen graph.cpp -o gen graph
  ```
  
  * compiling sequential code
  ```sh
      g++ -std=c++17 -O3 seq.cpp -o seq
  ```
  
  * compiling parallel code (StandardLibrary)
  ```sh
      g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -pthread par.cpp -o par
  ```
  
  * compiling parallel code (Fastflow)
  ```sh
      g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -pthread -I fastflow ff.cpp -o ff
  ```

* Generate graphs
   ```sh
   ./gen_graph total nodes min edges max edges max value seed
   ```
* Sequential Execution
   ```sh
   ./seq num nodes min edges max edges start node value active wait(0/1) debug(0/1)
   ```
   
* Parallel Execution (StandardLibrary)
   ```js
   ./par num nodes min edges max edges start node value num workers active wait(0/1) debug(0/1)
   ```
* Parallel Execution (Fastflow)
   ```js
   ./ff num nodes min edges max edges start node value num workers active wait(0/1) debug(0/1)
   ```
